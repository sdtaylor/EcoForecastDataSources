### Land Cover Forecasts
After weather and climate land cover may be the next most important input to ecological systems. Unfortunately making forecasts of the future land cover is hard and not many groups do it. 

- [Land-cover Modeling at USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center](https://landcover-modeling.cr.usgs.gov/projects.php). The USGS has land cover forecasts at a 250m spatial and 1 year temporal resolution, going out to 2100 for several IPCC scenarios. 

### NDVI Forecasts
There is currently no NDVI forecasts available.
